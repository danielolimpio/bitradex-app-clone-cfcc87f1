            This Risk Disclosure and Disclaimer ("Disclaimer") is an integral part of the BitradeX Terms of Service ("Terms of Service"). Capitalized terms not defined herein shall have the meanings assigned to them in the Terms of Service. Please read this document carefully to understand the significant risks and compliance considerations associated with using the BitradeX platform.

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">1. Purpose</h2>
            <p>
              BitradeX is committed to operating a secure, compliant, and transparent digital asset trading platform. To this end, we have implemented a comprehensive Anti-Money Laundering, Counter-Terrorist Financing, and Sanctions Compliance Program ("AML/CFT/Sanctions Program"). This Program reflects our dedication to upholding legal standards, fostering trust with users and regulators, and maintaining a strong reputation within the global digital asset ecosystem.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div>
            <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">2. Business Model</h2>
            <p className="mb-4">
              The BitradeX platform operates as a global digital asset exchange that connects buyers and sellers—commonly referred to as market makers and market takers. Our core function is to facilitate peer-to-peer transactions between users. However, as outlined in the Terms of Service, certain transactions may involve BitradeX affiliates acting as counterparties under specific circumstances.
            </p>
            <p className="font-semibold mb-2">Risk Disclosure:</p>
            <p>
              Trading and holding digital assets involves substantial risk. The value of digital assets can be highly volatile, and you may lose all or a significant portion of your invested capital. You should carefully assess whether trading digital assets aligns with your financial circumstances, investment objectives, and risk tolerance.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div>
            <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">3. Regulatory Environment</h2>
            <p className="mb-4">
              Global regulatory approaches to digital assets vary significantly. Some jurisdictions classify digital assets as "convertible virtual currencies" (e.g., per the U.S. Financial Crimes Enforcement Network – FinCEN) or "virtual commodities" (e.g., in Hong Kong). BitradeX views all digital assets listed on its platform as innovative alternative asset classes—not as legal tender, currency, or money.

            <p className="mb-4">
              Trading digital assets carries a high degree of risk. Prices can fluctuate dramatically in short periods, and there is no guarantee of profit—or even the return of principal.
            </p>
            
            <div className="space-y-6">
              <div>
                <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-3">5.1 Foreign Exchange Conversion Risk</h3>
                <p>
                  If you fund your account using a credit or debit card in a local currency, your payment will undergo an automated foreign exchange (FX) conversion process. System errors or technical failures during this process—determined at BitradeX's sole discretion—may result in a USD or USDT balance that differs from the expected amount based on the exchange rate at the time of payment. You acknowledge and accept that you bear all risks and costs associated with such FX conversion discrepancies.

                <p className="mb-3 font-semibold">You should be aware that:</p>
                <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
                  <li>BitradeX SG operates under a MAS licensing exemption for DPT services. This means your funds and DPTs are not protected by statutory compensation schemes. In the event of insolvency of BitradeX SG or a third party, you may lose all money or DPTs you have deposited.</li>
                  <li>Do not trade DPTs unless you understand how they work, including their creation, transfer mechanisms, and custody arrangements.</li>
                  <li>DPT values can fluctuate significantly. Only invest funds you can afford to lose entirely.</li>
                  <li>BitradeX may offer services related to "stablecoins" (DPTs designed to maintain a stable value), but even these are not risk-free and may depeg or lose value.</li>

                  <li><strong>Fiat Currency:</strong> Your SGD or other fiat funds are held in trust in segregated accounts at one or more licensed, third-party banking institutions, solely for the benefit of BitradeX Singapore users.</li>
                  <li><strong>Digital Payment Tokens (DPTs):</strong> Your DPTs are held in secure custody via a combination of cold wallets (≥95%) and hot wallets (≤5%) operated by BitradeX affiliates, under a formal Safeguarding Agreement. Access to these wallets is strictly controlled and monitored.</li>
                  <li><strong>Bankruptcy Protection:</strong> In the unlikely event of BitradeX SG's insolvency, your fiat and DPT assets will not form part of the company's estate and should be protected from claims by general creditors, in accordance with current Singapore law and industry practice.</li>
                  <li><strong>No Unauthorized Activity:</strong> BitradeX SG will not move or use your assets without your explicit instruction.</li>
