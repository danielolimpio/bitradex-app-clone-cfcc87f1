                    Digital assets are subject to extreme price volatility. The value of your holdings can fluctuate significantly over short periods, potentially resulting in substantial gains or losses. Historical price movements are not indicative of future performance.

                    Digital asset markets may experience periods of low liquidity, making it difficult to execute trades at desired prices. During times of market stress, liquidity can disappear rapidly, potentially preventing you from exiting positions or resulting in significant slippage.
