            <p className="mb-4">
              Trading digital assets involves significant risk and may not be suitable for all individuals. Digital asset prices are highly volatile and can be influenced by market sentiment, regulatory developments, technological issues, or geopolitical events. You could lose your entire investment in a short period.

              Digital asset regulation varies by jurisdiction and may be limited, evolving, or even prohibited. Changes in laws or enforcement actions by authorities—unrelated to BitradeX—could negatively impact your ability to use, transfer, or hold digital assets.
